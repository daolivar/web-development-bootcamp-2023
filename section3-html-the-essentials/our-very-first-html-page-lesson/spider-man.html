    <!-- More detailed information about Spider-Man, including his origin story -->
    <p>
      Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter
      was depicted as a teenage high school student and an orphan raised by his
      Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
      Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with
      the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many
      supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry
      Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black
      Cat; and enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In
      his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and
      abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include
      superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination,
      and balance, clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and
      detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He
      builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial
      spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and for
      web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for
      his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that
      Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by
      becoming Spider-Man.

    <p>
      In Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, Midtown High School student Peter
      Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and
      Aunt May. As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by
      a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at
      a science exhibit and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of
      an arachnid". Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the
      ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his knack for science, he
      develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design
      through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on
      his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a
      novelty television star. However, "he blithely ignores the chance to stop
      a fleeing thief, and his indifference ironically catches up with him when
      the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben." Spider-Man tracks
      and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption,
      "With great power there must also comeâ€”great responsibility!"

    <!-- Information about Spider-Man's superhuman powers and abilities -->
    <p>
      Peter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from
      mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive spider. Since the
      original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to
      walls. This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent
      interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals
      force, though in the 2002 Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined
      with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider's feet.
      Spider-Man's other powers include superhuman strength, agility, and
      balance and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his "spider sense",
      which alerts him to danger.
