    <!-- More detailed information about Spider-Man, including his origin story -->
    <p>
      Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter
      was depicted as a teenage high school student and an orphan raised by his
      Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
      Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with
      the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many
      supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry
      Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black
      Cat; and enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In
      his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and
      abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include
      superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination,
      and balance, clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and
      detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He
      builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial
      spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and for
      web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for
      his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that
      Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by
      becoming Spider-Man.
